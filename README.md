# 🛒 E-commerce Store Management System

This project is a web-based **e-commerce system** developed to simulate a full-featured online shopping experience. It supports multiple user roles, authentication, and blockchain-based payment simulation, demonstrating modern web development practices and secure transaction handling.

## ⚙️ About the Project

The system allows customers to browse products, place orders, and track deliveries. Store owners can manage products and orders, while couriers can update delivery statuses. Payments are simulated using **Ethereum smart contracts**, providing a realistic blockchain integration example.

The project emphasizes modular design, role-based access control, and secure transaction handling in a web application context.
